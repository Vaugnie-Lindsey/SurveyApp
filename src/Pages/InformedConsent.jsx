          The purpose of this study is to gain knowledge of experiences of women
          in stem and to examine different strategies for increasing the length
          of referral chains, improving the effectiveness of respondent-driven
          sampling, and to test a mobile app for taking surveys.

          Your participation in this study will involve taking a survey, and,
          optionally, inviting your friends and acquaintances to take part in
